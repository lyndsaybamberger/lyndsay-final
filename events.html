<p>One of the first events that Postell set-up, ran and managed with his new born company was Indy Popcon in 2016. Managing thousand of guests constantly coming and going- he left a footprint on indypopcon forever.  </p>
	
<p>Another even that Postell managed was at GenCon in 2016. This was the largest even that Postell has ever overseen and facilited. With multiple formats for gaming, watching and audience participation-GenCon went off without a hitch at the reign of Postell. </p>
	
<p>Going forward Postell oversaw hundreds of events- not just in esports- but in almost every arena an event planner can think of. Weddings, reunions, gatherings, and so much more.   </p>
